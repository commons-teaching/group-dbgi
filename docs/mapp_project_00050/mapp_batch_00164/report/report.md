## Introduction
Throughout evolution, plant species have developed different traits to adapt and survive in response to environmental pressures. One known strategy is the production of specialized metabolites, which often serve as  defenses by making the plant unpalatable or toxic to herbivores. They can also be useful for attracting pollinators, allelopathy, attracting and selecting microorganisms,... These metabolites not only play a vital role in plant survival, but they have also long attracted human interest. Over time, humans observed and studied plants, gradually recognizing their unique properties and harnessing them primarily for food and medicine, and in some cases, even for fishing or hunting. Today, the field of metabolomics seeks to investigate and understand these specialized compounds, exploring how plants use them to interact with their environment and defend themselves.   
  
In many tropical regions, indigenous communities still live in close relationship with nature and rely on plant-derived metabolites for surviving and hunting. In this context, our study focused on three tropical plant species of particular interest: _Derris elliptica_, _Erythroxylum coca_, and _Strophanthus hispidus_. These plants belonging to different genera are known for producing bioactive molecules with pharmacological interest and for their use in indigenous communities.
  
For example [_Derris ellipctica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derris_elliptica) is a plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This plant is well-known for containing a potent flavonoid called [rotenone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q412388) in its roots. Indigenous communities use this metabolite by crushing the roots and releasing them into water to stun and gather fishes. Moreover _Derris elliptica_ is also employed in traditional medicine to treat various conditions like bleeding, toothaches or stomachaches[^1]. Rotenone has also been studied for its pesticidal properties however its use has declined mainly due to concerns about its suspected link to Parkinson's disease. This plant remains an important example of how natural metabolites can be useful in traditional societies[^2].
  
[_Erythroxylum coca_](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroxylum_coca) is a plant native to South America. It is a small shrub that can reach 3 meters in height and grows in humid forests. It is known worldwide to be the source of a psychoactive alkaloid, [cocaine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41576). This metabolite present in the leaves of the plant is used as a narcotic, but it also for anesthetic properties in medical applications. _Erythroxylum coca_ was also used for the production of liqueurs and drinks. The original recipe for "Coca-Cola" and some wines were flavored by adding the leaves of the plant.

[_Strophantus Hispidus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strophanthus_hispidus) belonging to the genus _Strophantus_ and family of _Apocyaceneae_ is native to the african continent and common in tropical regions as well as savannah forests predominantly in Ghana, Senegal, Sudan, Congo DR, Uganda, and Tanzania[^3]. Local names for the plants are differing and there are more than 40 names commonly known in West-Africa often referring to its poisenous compounds[^4]. Most well known is the plants use as an arrow poison[^5]. The plant also has its use for traditional medicinal applications, as such Agyara et al. have proven its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and enhanced wound healing properties. In western Europe the plant found its use as a heart stimulant and to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias[^6]. The main group of characteristic compounds found in _Strophantus hispidus_ are the _strophantines_ also known as 'ouabain' belonging to the group of _cardinolides_ and cardiac glycosides.

The objective of this study is to use metabolomics to confirm the presence of the known bioactive metabolites produced by these three plants and to try to define similarities and differences they possess among each other.

## Material and Methods
### Samples collection
Samples from the three plants in our study were collected at the botanical garden of the University of Fribourg. The samples were collected using sterile scalpels and scissors and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to minimize alterations of their metabolomes caused by the gathering.
