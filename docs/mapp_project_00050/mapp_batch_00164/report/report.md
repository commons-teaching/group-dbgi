## Introduction
Throughout evolution, plant species have developed different traits to adapt and survive in response to environmental pressures. One known strategy is the production of specialized metabolites, which often serve as defenses by making the plant unpalatable or toxic to herbivores. They can also be useful for attracting pollinators, allelopathy, attracting and selecting microorganisms. These metabolites not only play a vital role in plant survival, but they have also long attracted human interest. Over time, humans observed and studied plants, gradually recognizing their unique properties and harnessing them primarily for food and medicine, and in some cases for fishing and hunting. Today, the field of metabolomics seeks to investigate and understand these specialized compounds, exploring how plants use them to interact with their environment and defend themselves.   
  
In many tropical regions, indigenous communities still live in close relationship with nature and rely on plant-derived metabolites for surviving and hunting. In this context, our study focused on three tropical plant species of particular interest: _Derris elliptica_, _Erythroxylum coca_, and _Strophanthus hispidus_. These plants belonging to different genera are known for producing bioactive molecules with pharmacological interest and for their use in indigenous communities (sources).
  
[_Derris ellipctica_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derris_elliptica__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nlkrmkp0$ ) is a plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This plant is well-known for containing a potent flavonoid called [rotenone](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q412388__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nTfV0Tbs$ ) in its roots. Indigenous communities use this metabolite by crushing the roots and releasing them into water to stun and gather fishes. Moreover _Derris elliptica_ is also employed in traditional medicine to treat various conditions like bleeding, toothaches or stomachaches[^1]. Rotenone has also been studied for its pesticidal properties however its use has declined mainly due to concerns about its suspected link to Parkinson's disease. This plant remains an important example of how natural metabolites can be useful in traditional societies[^2].
  
[_Erythroxylum coca_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroxylum_coca__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nTwXjPmc$ ) is a plant native to South America. It is a small shrub that can reach 3 meters in height and grows in humid forests. It is known worldwide to be the source of a psychoactive alkaloid, [cocaine](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41576__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nczKv4rY$ ). This metabolite present in the leaves of the plant is used as a narcotic, but it also for anesthetic properties in medical applicationsm (source). _Erythroxylum coca_ was also used for the production of liqueurs and drinks. The original recipe for "Coca-Cola" and some wines were flavored by adding the leaves of the plant (source).

[_Strophantus Hispidus_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strophanthus_hispidus__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nIz8Erko$ ) belonging to the genus _Strophantus_ and family of _Apocyaceneae_ is native to the african continent and common in tropical regions as well as savannah forests predominantly located in Ghana, Senegal, Sudan, Congo DR, Uganda, and Tanzania[^3]. Local names for the plants are differing and there are more than 40 names commonly used in West-Africa often referring to its poisenous compounds[^4]. Most well known is the plant's use as an arrow poison[^5]. The plant also has its use for traditional medicinal applications, as such Agyara et al. have proven its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and enhanced wound healing properties. In western Europe the plant found its use as a heart stimulant and to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias[^6]. The main group of characteristic compounds found in _Strophantus hispidus_ are the _strophantines_ also known as [ouabain](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60074861__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nAK-oSEs$ ) belonging to the group of _cardinolides_ and cardiac glycosides.

The objective of our study is to use metabolomics to confirm the presence of the known bioactive metabolites produced by these three plants and to define similarities and differences in their composition.

## Material and methods
### Samples collection
In our study, samples from the three plants were collected from the tropical greenhouse of Jardin de Botanique de l'UniversitÃ© de Fribourg (Chem. du MusÃ©e 10, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland). Pictures of the plants were taken and uploaded in the DGBI project in the iNaturalist domain ([_Derris ellipctica_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/117770419__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nzN9vPlU$ ), [_Erythroxylum coca_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861685__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nLzCyMgU$ ) and [_Strophantus Hispidus_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/117770425__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nSOrA_gw$ ) ). Samples were collected using sterile scalpels to cut two plant leaves, which were wrapped in coffee filters for protection. The wrapped leaves were placed inside a 50 mL Falcon tube and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to minimize alterations of their metabolomes caused by oxidation with environmental air.

### Samples preparation
We collected 150 Î¼g of plant tissue fragments for every plant. Fragments were placed in an Eppendorf and 1.5 mL of solvent (80% methanol, 20% water and 0.1% formic acid) was added. Three stainless steel spheres were added. The Eppendorfs were inserted into a Retsch machine (company and address) for 3 minutes (was longer for our samples, does it matter?) to break the tissues into smaller fragments and extract metabolites. Thereafter, the samples were centrifuged to separate the phases. One mL of supernatant was taken and placed in glass tubes for analysis. (internal standard used, do we know that?)

### LC-MS analysis
Liquid chromatography followed by (tandem MS?, in that case we would have to write LC-MS/MS everywhere) mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS) was used to analyze the samples. The analysis started with an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) (ThermoFisher megaUPLC 3000 xyz, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, 168 Third Avenue, Waltham, MA USA 02451), a more sensitive and rapid version of HPLC. The molecules were separated via a reverse-phase column (brand, length, etc.) dependent on their polarity. Afterwards, the liquid was injected inside the mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Orbi Qtrap Quatrupole hyper 5000 xyz, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, 168 Third Avenue, Waltham, MA USA 02451), where an MS/MS analysis was performed to quantify the metabolome.

### Data treatment
The data obtained from the LC-MS was converted to a format (which format?) supported by MZmine (version 4.6.1) by [ProteoWizard](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_ntjr00pw$ ) (version xy). The data was processed by the following order to obtain the features list of our samples: 
- Mass peak detection: In this initial step, the peaks from the spectrometry data were identified, differentiating true peaks and removing noise.
- Chromatogram building: A chromatogram (XIC/EIC) was created for each detected ion. This allows the visualization of temporal changes of ions' intensity and showing their retention time.
- Chromatogram deconvolution: Here peaks were identified and separated in the chromatogram.
- Isotope grouping: In this penultimate step, the isotopes of each ion were grouped into a single feature to obtain the monoisomeric mass.
- Feature alignment: The last step was aligning the features detected in each sample to compare their  intensities.

The parameters that were used to treat the data are found [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/commons-teaching/group-dbgi/blob/main/docs/mapp_project_00050/mapp_batch_00164/results/mzmine/mapp_batch_00164.mzbatch__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nQae__Uo$ ).

With the processed data and metadata, a molecular network was created with [Cytoscape](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cytoscape.org/__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_n05x2TIQ$ ) (version 3.10.3) to visualize the composition of detected features. (We should also mention the apps we installed and which libraries we used to classify the results)


## Results

### MS1
In total we obtained 5839 features in the [final peak list](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/commons-teaching/group-dbgi/blob/main/aligned_feature_list.csv__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nrpgjDXc$ ). After removing blanks, 5694 features were left ([link](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/commons-teaching/group-dbgi/blob/main/aligned_feature_list_samples2.csv__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_noPbOFJo$ )).   

A heatmap was generated showing an overview of all metabolites cointained in our samples.

The heatmap compares the metabolome profiles of the three plant species samples. _Derris elliptica_ shows a broad diversity of metabolites with a balanced contribution of terpenoids, fatty acids, phenylpropanoids and alkaloids. _Erythroxylum coca_ is dominated by alkaloids and terpenoids, concording with its known bioactivity. _Strophanthus hispidus'_ metabolome is constituted mainly of terpenoids, with the biggest subgroup being cardenolides.  


Below are the molecular networks that we have generated. The controls have the color gray, while _Derris elliptica_ is represented by the color green, _Erythroxylum coca_ by yellow and _Strophanthus hispidus_ by purple. For metabolite identification, the spectra were aligned with databases from [Canopus](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/canopus/__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nKD0b7x4$ ), [GNPS](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://gnps.ucsd.edu/index.html__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_n22xQZcQ$ ) and [ISDB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://zenodo.org/records/8287341__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_nOVn1WuI$ ).

Concerning _Derris ellipctica_ we were unable to find any cluster related to rotenone in the nodes network. A literature review reveiled that this compound is mainly concentred in the roots of the plant[^7]. As we collected the leaves we didn't find anything related to this metabolite. However a cluster showing unique compounds to _Derris ellipctica_ was identified (source).

  <p align="center">Graphic 3: Cluster 1, characteristic for _Derris elliptica_</p>  


The two main compounds of this cluster is Clerodendrin and Eriodictyol (capital letters?). Clerodendrin is a flavonoid commonly found in plants of the _Clerodendrum_ genus (source). Eriodictyol is a flavanone and also a well-characterized plant metabolite with antioxidant and neuroprotective effects (source). The presence of these two compounds in _Derris elliptica_ is coherent, as this species belongs to the _Fabaceae_ family, which is rich in flavonoid diversity making their detection plausible (source). Their absence or reduction in quantity in _Erythroxylum coca_ and _Strophanthus hispidus_ is also reasonable: the _Erythroxylum_ plant is more specialized in alkaloids and terpenoids and _Strophanthus hispidus_ is dominated by cardenolides, with much less flavonoid representation. Therefore the presence in the _Derris_ Plant and the absence in the two other plants align well with our heatmap (source). In the cluster, some nodes show a yellow or purple color. Our hypotesis is that the colomn was not totally cleaned after the injection of _Derris'_ extracts. Another possible explenation is that the other two plants can produce a similar molecule in smaller quantity (source or has to be validated in further research). 


![Erythroxylum coca overview](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19e42fad-f31c-4b73-9360-9f173ed82476__;!!L4CEoEA!oMgIxvuQ2eBdbUoieEaaumBnCsHyg61Wm5dVLRw3WVuUcXLYoJTQ_9hqN7HV2VYef7EfanTKSjM86EwN5o3KChiBcIFpbV_n-Ysiss4$ ) <p align="center">Graphic 4: Overview of the network of _Erythroxylum coca_</p>  

For _Erythroxylum coca_ we found a cluster that contains nodes traceable to cocaine and cinnamoylcocaine, a molecule structurally close to cocaine. A literature review revealed that cinnamolycocaine is also an alkaloid but despite the similarity with cocaine, it is pharmacologically inactive[^8].
We found in a cluster (Cluster 3) a compound called Spinosad that appears in both _Erythroxylum coca_. A second similar metabolite Spinosyn A was identified in _Strophantus hispidus_. Both Spinosad and Spinosyn A are used as an insecticide derived from the bacterium _Saccharopolyspora spinosa_ (source). It is commonly used in organic farming to protect crops (which crops?, from which insect? or is it a broad insecticide?) (source). One hypothesis we have is that this compound may have been applied as a pesticide in the botanical garden and then absorbed through the leaves of the plants. (Here it would be interesting to know if Spinosad is poisenous to humans)

For _Strophantus hispidus_ we were able to identify a cluster (Cluster 4) related to Strophanthidin, the characteristic terpenoid for _Strophantus_ plants and the main bioactive compound responsible for its cardiotoxic properties[^9]. Other metabolites in this cluster are classed as cardiac glycosides, (mostly _Cardenolides_ and _Bufadienolides_), characterized by their cardio active properties[^10]. Other bigger cluster (>10 nodes) exclusive to _Strophantus hispidus_ were classed as _Triterpenoids_, _Sesquiterpenoides_ and _Cardenolides_, fitting well with the _Terpenoid_ heavy composition of the metabolome (see Graphic 1).

We also have detected a cluster (Cluster 5) showing a compound, turanose, shared by the three plants. Turanose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. This molecule is poorly metabolized by plants but can be taken via specific transporters and acts like a signaling molecule[^11]. In Arabidopsis, turanose affects auxin-regulated root growth underlying its signaling role[^12]. A metabolomic study have detected turanose in a wide range of plants including barley, strawberry and tobacco, especially under stress conditions[^13]. Thus, its detection in _Derris elliptica_, _Erythroxylum coca_, and _Strophanthus hispidus_ is not so surprising.

(should we go into Scopoletin, is the strongest detection for strophantus, but also present in the other two, is a fairly common compound. Maybe not too interesting, btw. why is Cluster 5 in there with the Turanose?)

## Conclusion
We were able to extract, analyze and compare the metabolome from three different plant species, which could be identified by metabolite patterns and by characterizing single plant-specific metabolites. Thus, the method has proven effective in leaf samples. We were able to find expected compounds, i.e. cocaine and also the cardiotoxin strophantine produced by plants from the genus _Strophantus_. However, we were not able to find rotenone produced in the roots of _Derris Helliptica_ but not not in its leaves. We could identify clusters of related chemical compounds with features from a single plant as well as shared clusters between the three species. 
We noted with surprise the presence of a molecule that was probably not produced by the plants. Precisely, it was detected in the leaves of _Erythroxylum coca_ and _Strophanthus hispidus_, with its origin stemming from _Saccharopolyspora spinosa_ that was likely used to protect plants in the botanical garden. By comparing the compound to internet databases of plant and bacteria metabolites, a potential externality bias was avoided. No further metabolites tracing to external contamination were identified.
_Derris elliptica_ roots warrant further investigation. Of potential scientific interest could be a comparative study of different plant tissues' metabolomes from the same plant to explore physiological processes and bioactive compounds.
