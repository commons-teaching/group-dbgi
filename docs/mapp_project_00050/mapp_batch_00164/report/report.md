## Introduction
Plants have always been a source of human interest. Human beings have observed, studied and exploited these living things and have learned to recognize the properties of different species . Plants have thus assumed a fundamental role in food, medicine, construction and many other areas.  

For example _Derris ellipctica_ is used in traditional medicine to treat various conditions like bleeding,  toothache or stomachache (Khan, 2006).
