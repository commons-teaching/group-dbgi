## Introduction
Throughout evolution, plant species have developed different traits to adapt and survive in response to environmental pressures. One known strategy is the production of specialized metabolites, which often serve as  defenses by making the plant unpalatable or toxic to herbivores. They can also be useful for attracting pollinators, allelopathy, attracting and selecting microorganisms,... These metabolites not only play a vital role in plant survival, but they have also long attracted human interest. Over time, humans observed and studied plants, gradually recognizing their unique properties and harnessing them primarily for food and medicine, and in some cases, even for fishing or hunting. Today, the field of metabolomics seeks to investigate and understand these specialized compounds, exploring how plants use them to interact with their environment and defend themselves.   
  
In many tropical regions, indigenous communities still live in close relationship with nature and rely on plant-derived metabolites for surviving and hunting. In this context, our study focused on three tropical plant species of particular interest: _Derris elliptica_, _Erythroxylum coca_, and _Strophanthus hispidus_. These plants belonging to different genera are known for producing bioactive molecules with pharmacological interest and for their use in indigenous communities.
  
For example [_Derris ellipctica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derris_elliptica) is a plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This plant is well-known for containing a potent metabolite  called rotenone in its roots. Indigenous communities use this compound by crushing the roots and releasing them into water to stun and gather fishes. Moreover _Derris elliptica_ is also employed in traditional medicine to treat various conditions like bleeding, toothaches or stomachaches[^1]. Rotenone has also been studied for its pesticidal properties however its use has declined mainly due to concerns about its suspected link to Parkinson's disease. This plant remains an important example of how natural metabolites can be useful in traditional societies[^2].
  
[_Erythroxylum coca_](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroxylum_coca) is a plant native to South America. It is a small shrub that can reach 3 meters in height and grows in humid forests. It is known worldwide to be the source of a psychoactive alkaloid, [cocaine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41576). This metabolite present in the leaves of the plant is used as a narcotic, but it also for anesthetic properties in medical applications. _Erythroxylum coca_ was also used for the production of liqueurs and drinks. The original recipe for "Coca-Cola" and some wines were flavored by adding the leaves of the plant.  

The objective of this study is to use metabolomics to confirm the presence of the known bioactive metabolites produced by these three plants and to try to define similarities and differences they possess among each other.
