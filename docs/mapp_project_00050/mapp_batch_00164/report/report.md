## Introduction
Throughout evolution, plant species have developed different traits to adapt and survive in response to environmental pressures. One known strategy is the production of specialized metabolites, which often serve as  defenses by making the plant unpalatable or toxic to herbivores. These metabolites not only play a vital role in plant survival, but they have also long attracted human interest. Over time, plants were observed and studied, and humans recognized their unique properties and applied them for food and medicine priduction, but also for hunting. Today, the field of metabolomics seeks to investigate and understand these specialized compounds, exploring how plants use them to interact with their environment and defend themselves.   
  
In many tropical regions, indigenous communities still live in close relationship with nature and rely on plant-derived metabolites for surviving and hunting. In this context, our study focused on three tropical plant species of particular interest: _Derris elliptica_, _Erythroxylum coca_, and _Strophanthus hispidus_.   
  
For example [_Derris ellipctica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derris_elliptica) is used in traditional medicine to treat various conditions like bleeding, toothache or stomachache (Khan, 2006).  
  
[_Erythroxylum coca_](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroxylum_coca) is a plant native to South America. It is a small shrub that can reach 3 meters in height and grows in humid forests. It is known worldwide to be the source of a psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine. This metabolite is used as a narcotic, but it also possesses anesthetic interest. _Erythroxylum coca_ was also used for the production of liqueurs and drinks. The original recipe for "Coca-Cola" and some wines were flavored by adding the leaves of the plant.
